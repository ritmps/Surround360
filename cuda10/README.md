# Our own little cuda 10 + ubuntu 16 image

As nvidia obeslesces its varuous docker containers, we need to build our own. 

It's pretty nutty. But here you go

## cuda10 needed libcudnn

cuda10/libcudnn7_7.6.5.32-1+cuda10.2_amd64.deb
cuda10/libcudnn7-dev_7.6.5.32-1+cuda10.2_amd64.deb

which are from
